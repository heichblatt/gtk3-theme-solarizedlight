* Introduction *

This package contains a gtk 3 theme template.
I am not a themer, so if something is wrong, let me know!
I made this since gtk 3 is quite new, and theming is not easy.
This might make it easier for some people.

Everything in the template path is public domain.
The rest is GPL3 licensed.


* Using the template *

1. Copy the template directory to ~/.themes/ and rename it to your theme name.
2. Edit the template to your liking.
3. Share your theme (for example at www.gnome-look.org).


* Contact and contributing *

You can either email me at pustjens@dds.nl, or use the comments section on
www.gnome-look.org (probably where you downloaded the template).

Help me improve the template and share your experiences.
Perhaps you can provide small examples of not-so-common theming tricks?
Even examples of common theming which is not in the template will help
others. Also consider submitting application specific theming examples.

You are also welcome to setup a webpage for this (git+tracker+ml+forum perhaps?)


* Generating the template *

In order to generate the template using the `gtk-theme-template.py' script
yourself, first get a (recent) copy of the gtk 3 sources. Also install
gtk-doc (http://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/). gtk-doc contains the tools to generate
the documentation during a build of gtk 3. Apply the patch
`gtk3-docs-xhtml.patch' to `/usr/share/gtk-doc/data/gtk-doc.xsl'. This
modifies the tools to generate xhtml instead of old-fashioned html. (its easy
to parse xhtml using python).

The next step is to build gtk 3. Do the following:
$ ./configure --enable-gtk-doc --enable-gtk-doc-html
$ make

If successful, this will leave the generated documentation in
`gtk+-3.x.x/docs/reference/gtk/html'.

Open the `gtk-theme-template.py' script and change the `htmlPathName'
variable to the path where your copy of the documentation is.
