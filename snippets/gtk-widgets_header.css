 * Style classes.

 * The style classes rules apply to any widget defining that class.
 * For example, the .buttons class applies to all types of buttons,
 * and allows you to theme all these types of buttons using a single
 * set of rules.
 *
 * You can use all style properties defined for any of the class
 * members in the class rules. These properties can be found in
 * 'Template\Widgets\WidgetName.css'.
